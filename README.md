# Metroidvania Month 20

Git repository for the Metroidvania Month 20 game jam.

## Submitting scenes
When updating a scene, make sure to duplicate the scene you are trying to work on and use the copy for all development. This will help to avoid merge conflicts if two people need to work on the same scene.
Then, when you need to commit to source control, you should first pull to update the original scene and then copy over any scene changes you made. Then you can commit and push.

## Submitting code/assets
C# scripts play nice with Git and merging so no precautions are needed there. In theory two people should not need to work on the same asset at once so assets may be freely pushed as well. Be sure to organize everything properly in the correct folders.
